== Divided Element Extension (Extension `Zvediv`)

NOTE: The EDIV extension is currently not planned to be part of the
base "V" extension, and will change substantially from this current
sketch.

NOTE: This section has not been updated to account for new mask format
in v0.9.

The divided element extension allows each element to be treated as a
packed sub-vector of narrower elements. This provides efficient
support for some forms of narrow-width and mixed-width arithmetic, and
also to allow outer-loop vectorization of short vector and matrix
operations.  In addition to modifying the behavior of some existing
instructions, a few new instructions are provided to operate on
vectors when EDIV > 1.

The divided element extension adds a two-bit field, `vediv[1:0]` to
the `vtype` register.

include::vtype-ediv-format.adoc[]

The `vediv` field encodes the number of ways, _EDIV_, into which each
SEW-bit element is subdivided into equal sub-elements.  A vector
register group is now considered to hold a vector of sub-vectors.

| 0 | 0 | 1 | (undivided, as in base)
| 0 | 1 | 2 | two equal sub-elements
| 1 | 0 | 4 | four equal sub-elements
| 1 | 1 | 8 | eight equal sub-elements
|===


The assembly syntax for vsetvli has additional options added to encode
the EDIV options.

|===

Each implementation defines a minimum size for a sub-element, _SELEN_,
which must be at most 8 bits.

NOTE: While _SELEN_ is a fourth implementation-specific parameter,
values smaller than 8 would be considered an additional extension.

=== Instructions not affected by EDIV

The vector start register `vstart` and exception reporting continue to
work as before.

The vector length `vl` control and vector masking continue to operate
at the element level.

Vector masking continues to operate at the element level, so
sub-elements cannot be individually masked.

NOTE: SEW can be changed dynamically to enabled per-element masking
for sub-elements of 8 bits and greater.

Vector load/store and AMO instructions are unaffected by EDIV, and
continue to move whole elements.

Vector mask logical operations are unchanged by EDIV setting, and
continue to operate on vector registers containing element masks.

Vector mask population count (`vpopc`), find-first and related
instructions (`vfirst`, `vmsbf`, `vmsif`, `vmsof`), iota (`viota`),
and element index (`vid`) instructions are unaffected by EDIV.

Vector integer bit insert/extract, and integer and floating-point
scalar move instruction are unaffected by EDIV.

Vector slide-up/slide-down are unaffected by EDIV.

Vector compress instructions are unaffected by EDIV.

=== Instructions Affected by EDIV

==== Regular Vector Arithmetic Instructions under EDIV

Most vector arithmetic operations are modified to operate on the
individual sub-elements, so effective SEW is SEW/EDIV and effective
vector length is `vl` * EDIV.  For example, a vector add of 32-bit
elements with a `vl` of 5 and EDIV of 4, operates identically to a
vector add of 8-bit elements with a vector length of 20.

----
vsetvli t0, a0, e32,m1,d4  # Vectors of 32-bit elements, divided into byte sub-elements
vadd.vv v1,v2,v3                     # Performs a vector of 4*vl 8-bit additions.
vsll.vx v1,v2,x1                     # Performs a vector of 4*vl 8-bit shifts.
----

==== Vector Add with Carry/Subtract with Borrow Reserved under EDIV>1

For EDIV > 1, `vadc`, `vmadc`, `vsbc`, `vmsbc` are reserved.

==== Vector Reduction Instructions under EDIV

Vector single-width integer sum reduction instructions are reserved
under EDIV>1.  Other vector single-width reductions and vector
widening integer sum reduction instructions now operate independently
on all elements in a vector, reducing sub-element values within an
element to an element-wide result.

The scalar input is taken from the least-significant bits of the
second operand, with the number of bits equal to the number of
significant result bits (i.e., for sum and dot reductions, the number
of bits are given in table above, for non-sum and non-dot reductions,
equal to the element size).

----
# Sum each sub-vector of four bytes into a 16-bit result.
vsetvli t0, a0, e32,d4  # Vectors of 32-bit elements, divided into byte sub-elements
vwredsum.vs v1, v2, v3 # v1[i][15:0] = v2[i][31:24] + v2[i][23:16]
                       #              + v2[i][15:8] + v2[i][7:0] + v3[i][15:0]

# Find maximum among sub-elements
vredmax.vs v5, v6, v7 # v5[i][7:0] = max(v6[i][31:24], v6[i][23:16],
                      #                    v6[i][15:8], v6[i][7:0], v7[i][7:0])
----

Integer sub-element non-sum reductions produce a final result that is
max(8,SEW/EDIV) bits wide, sign- or zero-extended to full SEW if
necessary.

Integer sub-element widening sum reductions produce a final result
that is max(8,min(SEW,2*SEW/EDIV)) bits wide, sign- or zero-extended
to full SEW if necessary.

Single-width floating-point reductions produce a final result that is
SEW/EDIV bits wide.

Widening floating-point sum reductions produce a final result that is
min(2*SEW/EDIV,FLEN) bits wide, NaN-boxed to the full SEW width if
necessary.

==== Vector Register Gather Instructions under EDIV

Vector register gather instructions under non-zero EDIV only gather
sub-elements within the element.  The source and index values are
interpreted as relative to the enclosing element only.  Index values
{ge} EDIV write a zero value into the result sub-element.

----

       |       |       |  SEW = 32b, EDIV=4
        7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0  bytes
        d e a d b e e f  v1
        0 1 9 2 0 2 3 2  v2
                            vrgather.vv v3, v1, v2
        d a 0 e f e b e  v3
                            vrgather.vi v4, v1, 1
        a a a a e e e e  v4
----

NOTE: Vector register gathers with scalar or immediate arguments can
"splat" values across sub-elements within an element.

NOTE: Implementations can provide fast implementations of register
gathers constrained within a single element width.

=== Vector Integer Dot-Product Instruction

The integer dot-product reduction `vdot.vv` performs an element-wise
multiplication between the source sub-elements then accumulates the
results into the destination vector element.  Note the assembler syntax
uses a `.vv` suffix since both inputs are vectors of elements.

Sub-element integer dot reductions produce a final result
that is max(8,min(SEW,4*SEW/EDIV)) bits wide, sign- or zero-extended
to full SEW if necessary.

# Signed dot-product
vdot.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector

  # Dot product, SEW=32, EDIV=1
  vdot.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # vd[i][31:0] += vs2[i][31:0] * vs1[i][31:0]

  # Dot product, SEW=32, EDIV=2
  vdot.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm # vd[i][31:0] += vs2[i][31:16] * vs1[i][31:16]
                                            + vs2[i][15:0] * vs1[i][15:0]

  # Dot product, SEW=32, EDIV=4
  vdot.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm # vd[i][31:0] += vs2[i][31:24] * vs1[i][31:24]
                                            + vs2[i][23:16] * vs1[i][23:16]
                                            + vs2[i][15:8] * vs1[i][15:8]
                                            + vs2[i][7:0] * vs1[i][7:0]
----

=== Vector Floating-Point Dot Product Instruction

The floating-point dot-product reduction `vfdot.vv` performs an element-wise
multiplication between the source sub-elements then accumulates the
results into the destination vector element.  Note the assembler syntax
uses a `.vv` suffix since both inputs are vectors of elements.

----
# Signed dot-product
vfdot.vv vd, vs2, vs1, vm   # Vector-vector

----
# Dot product. SEW=32, EDIV=2
vfdot.vv  vd, vs2, vs1, vm # vd[i][31:0] += vs2[i][31:16] * vs1[i][31:16]
                                           + vs2[i][15:0] * vs1[i][15:0]

# Floating-point sub-vectors of two half-precision floats packed into 32-bit elements.
vsetvli t0, a0, e32,m1,d2  # Vectors of 32-bit elements, divided into 16b sub-elements
vfdot.vv v1, v2, v3   # v1[i][31:0] +=  v2[i][31:16]*v3[i][31:16] + v2[i][16:0]*v3[i][16:0]

# Floating-point sub-vectors of four half-precision floats packed into 64-bit elements.
vsetvli t0, a0, e64,m1,d4  # Vectors of 64-bit elements, divided into 16b sub-elements
vfdot.vv v1, v2, v3
                 # v1[i][31:0] +=  v2[i][31:16]*v3[i][31:16] + v2[i][16:0]*v3[i][16:0] +
                 #                 v2[i][63:48]*v3[i][63:48] + v2[i][47:32]*v3[i][47:32];
                 # v1[i][63:32] = ~0 (NaN boxing)

== Vector Quad-Widening Integer Multiply-Add Instructions (Extension `Zvqmac`)

NOTE: This is only a proposal for a future extension after v1.0 and
might change substantially before ratification.

The quad-widening integer multiply-add instructions add a SEW-bit*SEW-bit
multiply result to (from) a 4*SEW-bit value and produce a 4*SEW-bit
result.  All combinations of signed and unsigned multiply operands are
supported.

NOTE: These instructions are currently not planned to be part of the
base V extension.

NOTE: On ELEN=32 machines, only 8b * 8b = 16b products accumulated in
a 32b accumulator would be supported.  Machines with ELEN=64 would
also add 16b * 16b = 32b products accumulated in 64b.
